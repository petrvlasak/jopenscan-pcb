# JOpenScan - Pi Shield and Ringlight PCBs

These PCBs are compatible with the original OpenScan DIY 3D Scanner firmware. They contain some improvements:

- Pi Shield
  - Proper current limiting resistors for MOSFETs in Ringlight control
  - Software shutdown of stepper motors (available only in JOpenScan firmware)
- Ringlight
  - Removed unnecessary current limiting resistors
